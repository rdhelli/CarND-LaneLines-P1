**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline utilized the method of the classes with some fine-tuning and tricks. First the image is converted to grayscale, then a gaussian blurring follows, with a Kernel size of 5Ã—5 pixels, to reduce noise related sudden increments in the gradients.

The edges are then recoverable with the canny algorithm. I increased the thresholds to reduce unrelated content, which worked acceptably on the yellow lane lines too.

Then I created a polygon to mask only the region of interest. I used relative dimensions so that the method stays robust over different image sizes. The slight assymetry suggests that the camera was not positioned right in the middle.

Lines can be recovered with the help of a Hough transformation. Once again, I increased the thresholds to filter out smaller segments, as the dashed lane line can now be connected with greater line gaps (as long as classification is not required). This method helped limiting the number of line segments and stabilizing the detection pipeline.

To be able to build 2 continuous lane approximation lines, I modified the draw_lines() function. I classified the segments based on their theta angles into 3 categories: part of the right lane line if significantly positive, part of the left lane line if significantly negative, and a disturbance if close to zero. This method works practically over regular driving circumstances. The left and right segments are then averaged separately based on their slope and offset values. The resulting line equations were used to mark the endpoints in the region of interest.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One shortcoming can be the sudden change in lighting conditions, or worn out lane lines, or cracks on the road surfaces. Practically anything that creates a sudden change in the gradient in the region of interest. The bigger the region, the more disturbances, the smaller the region, the less precise the model becomes.

Another shortcoming is the lane line approximation with a straight lines. A curvature in the road could cause the lane lines to miss the selected region of interest, and even if they fall inside, the straight lines can only be a rough estimate of where the robot can go.

And lastly, such detection method is vulnerable against the traffic covering the visibility of the lane lines, as it lacks the creative extrapolating intuition of the human brains (or machine learning algorithms).

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to apply time-based filtering between the consecutive frames. The single frames are only sampling the reality, but with a high enough fps, a level of continuity can be assumed. Thus salient values should be treated with caution.

Another potential improvement could be to also search for curving lines that are made up of continuous straight line segments.

Another idea is to use vehicle dynamic variables, such as roll, pitch and yaw, to account for the changing angles and hence the changing perspective. The region of interest could be dynamically updated to surround the estimated trajectory.
